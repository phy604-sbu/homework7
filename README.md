# Working with your repo

When you followed the github classroom link, a repository was setup
for you of the form `phy604-sbu/homework-7-username`, where `username`
is your github username.

You can clone this repo to your local computer to do your work as:

```
git clone https://github.com/phy604-sbu/homework-7-username
```
(again, with your `username` in place).  Note, it is also possible to
clone via SSH if github knows about your computer.

As you create source code, you need to do the following to make it
seen by git and github, so I can see it and grade it when it is due.
Imagine you created a file called `program.c`:

  * `git add program.c`

  * `git commit program.c`

    you will be prompted to enter a commit message here describing
    your changes.

  * `git push`

    this will push your changes to github.  Depending on how your github
    is setup, you will be prompted for your password.

You need to do this each time you add a file.  If you change an existing
file, then you can skip the `git add` part, and just commit the changes.

Remember, if you don't `push` the changes, then I won't be able to see them.
